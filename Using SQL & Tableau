## 3.Process Phase:
     *Tools used*- I choose SQL to look into the data and clean the data for testing my SQL skills and 
                    Tableau for visualising the insights from the data i manipulated.
      
-- After loading the datas, First check the datas for uniqueness.
SELECT
 DISTINCT Genre --to check how many genre
  FROM `proven-octane-371516.Amazon_Top_Selling_books.Booklist`

SELECT DISTINCT Year --year 2009 to 2019
  FROM `proven-octane-371516.Amazon_Top_Selling_books.Booklist`

SELECT DISTINCT Name --351 Names
  FROM `proven-octane-371516.Amazon_Top_Selling_books.Booklist`

SELECT DISTINCT Author --248 Author Names
  FROM `proven-octane-371516.Amazon_Top_Selling_books.Booklist`
  ORDER BY Author
  
  

-- Update wrongly entered names (American Psychiatric Association,George R.R. Martin,J.K. Rowling )

UPDATE `proven-octane-371516.Amazon_Top_Selling_books.Booklist`
SET Author = 'American Psychological Association'
WHERE Author = 'American Psychiatric Association'
 
UPDATE `proven-octane-371516.Amazon_Top_Selling_books.Booklist`
SET Author = 'George R.R. Martin'
WHERE Author = 'George R. R. Martin'

UPDATE `proven-octane-371516.Amazon_Top_Selling_books.Booklist`
SET Author = 'J.K.Rowling'
WHERE Author = 'J. K. Rowling'

## 4.Analyze Phase:
-- During analysis phase, store the results in separate cvs files for using it in tableau.

--To view User rating for separate books with authors.
SELECT DISTINCT Name, Author, User_Rating
FROM `proven-octane-371516.Amazon_Top_Selling_books.Booklist`
ORDER BY User_Rating DESC

-- To view the reviews count for separate books.
SELECT DISTINCT Name, Reviews
FROM `proven-octane-371516.Amazon_Top_Selling_books.Booklist`
ORDER BY Reviews DESC

--To count genre
SELECT Genre, COUNT(Genre)
FROM `proven-octane-371516.Amazon_Top_Selling_books.Booklist`
GROUP BY Genre


## 5.Share Phase:
     From analysis process we collect tha data in csv files. 
     now, we use those files to work in tableau to find out the data we need by visualzing it in Tableau public.
     
     
## 6.Act Phase:
     From the viz. files we came to know about certain points that helps to impove the business. they are
     *1.* The Ficion genres books soled more than Non Fiction books. so company should focus on Fictional category more than Non Fictional.
     *2.* From ratings, we came to know about the interest of people. Non Fictional books receives high Ratings.
     *3.* The Reviews shows the author with most sales adn popular books.
     
     these points help the company to load stocks with certain types of books for the following years.
